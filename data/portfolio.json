            "aboutpara":"Thanks for checking out my website. My career has included time in multiple industries including financial services, fin-tech, and education. In 2020, I returned to my hometown high school to lead the business education department during the pandemic and taught classes on Computer Applications, Technology, Personal Finance, Accounting, Business, and Marketing. Life events brought me to the Greater SF Bay Area after my time teaching and I am now open to new opportunities in product management, marketing, or other related areas. While I do not consider myself an engineer, I am comfortable with general coding and editing while utilizing platforms like Visual Studio. Additional info showing my approach to different product scenarios and some subjects I covered as an educator can be viewed in my portfolio and resume.",
